# Set Autoencoder

An autoencoder for sets of elements. 
While set encoders have existed for some time, (such as [Deep Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06114)), 
there is currently no good method for decoding sets in prior literature. The difficulty of this problem
stems from the fact that sets have no ordering and a variable number of elements, while standard neural networks
produce a fixed number of outputs with a definite ordering. There are some networks which can produce a variable number
of outputs (like [RNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)), but they impose an ordering on the output.
The issue with these networks is that they recognise each ordering as a distinct output. Consequently,
the task of learning becomes combinatorialâ€“since the network can't generalise, it must be trained on each possible permutation
of the output.

Set Decoder Tasks:
- Prediction of a gaussian mixture model with a variable number of modes
- Prediction of multiple objects in a scene (e.g. objects = {blob at [-1,1], blob at [1,0]})

Autoencoder Tasks:
- Training communication in a GNN without a downstream objective
- Pre-training an encoder for a team of agents to produce a global state
